# Architecture Decision Record: Cost Monitoring for IoT Platform

## 1. Key Decisions for Cost Monitoring with Multi-Tenant Support

### ADR-001: Cost as a First-Class Concern
- **Decision**: Implement cost tracking and monitoring as a core feature of the IoT platform
- **Context**: Cost management is a critical non-functional requirement alongside security and performance
- **Rationale**: Treating cost as a first-class concern enables better financial planning and optimization
- **Consequences**: Additional development effort balanced by improved cost visibility and control

### ADR-002: Device-Level Cost Tracking Strategy
- **Decision**: Implement "cost per IoT device" metrics using resource tagging and AWS Cost Explorer
- **Context**: Need to understand costs at a granular level to optimize resource usage
- **Rationale**: Device-level cost tracking enables precise allocation of expenses to specific devices and tenants
- **Consequences**: More detailed cost insights at the expense of additional tagging and monitoring overhead

### ADR-003: Multi-Tenant Cost Allocation
- **Decision**: Use resource tagging to enable cost allocation across multiple tenants
- **Context**: SaaS platform requires tenant-specific cost tracking
- **Rationale**: Tagging resources with tenant identifiers allows for accurate cost allocation
- **Consequences**: Enables tenant-specific billing and cost optimization

### ADR-004: Automated Cost Monitoring and Alerting
- **Decision**: Implement automated cost dashboards and budget alerts
- **Context**: Need proactive monitoring of costs to prevent unexpected expenses
- **Rationale**: Automated monitoring enables timely intervention when costs exceed thresholds
- **Consequences**: Improved cost control with minimal operational overhead

## 2. Implementation Details

### Tagging Strategy
The following tags are applied to IoT resources:
- **TenantId**: Identifies the tenant that owns the device
- **DeviceId**: Identifies the specific IoT device
- **Service**: Identifies the service category (e.g., "IoT")
- **CostAllocation**: Indicates that the resource should be included in cost allocation

### Cost Monitoring Components
1. **Device Tagger Lambda**: Automatically tags IoT devices when they connect
2. **Cost Explorer Integration**: Processes cost data and publishes metrics to CloudWatch
3. **CloudWatch Dashboards**: Visualize cost metrics by device and tenant
4. **Budget Alerts**: Notify when costs exceed predefined thresholds

### Metrics and Dashboards
1. **Cost Per Device**: Tracks the cost of each IoT device over time
2. **Cost Per Tenant**: Aggregates costs across all devices for each tenant
3. **Message Volume**: Correlates message volume with costs to identify optimization opportunities
4. **Resource Utilization**: Monitors resource usage to identify underutilized or overprovisioned resources

## 3. Cost Optimization Strategies

### Scale Down Efficiency
The architecture is designed to scale down as efficiently as it scales up:
- Serverless components only incur costs when in use
- Automatic resource provisioning based on actual demand
- Storage tiering for cost-effective data retention

### Cost-Aware Culture
To instill a cost-aware culture:
1. Make cost dashboards accessible to all team members
2. Include cost impact analysis in design reviews
3. Celebrate cost optimization wins
4. Regularly review and optimize resource usage

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Activate Cost Allocation Tags**: Enable the cost allocation tags in AWS Billing
2. **Refine Cost Dashboards**: Customize dashboards based on user feedback
3. **Implement Cost Anomaly Detection**: Add anomaly detection to identify unusual cost patterns
4. **Develop Cost Optimization Recommendations**: Create automated recommendations for cost savings
5. **Integrate with Billing Systems**: Connect cost data with billing systems for chargeback
